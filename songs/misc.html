        <h2>We rise</h2>
        <p>
          We rise, humbly hearted <br>
          Rise, won&rsquo;t be divided <br>
          Rise, with spirit to guide us <br>
          Rise! <br> <br>
          
          In hope, in prayer, we find ourselves here <br>
          In hope, in prayer, we&rsquo;re right here <br>
          (x2) <br> <br>
          
          We rise, all of the children <br>
          Rise, elders with wisdom <br>
          Rise, ancestors surround us <br>
          Rise! <br> <br>
          
          In hope, in prayer, we find ourselves here <br>
          In hope, in prayer, we&rsquo;re right here <br>
          (x2) <br> <br>
          
          We rise, up from the wreckage <br>
          Rise, with tears and with courage <br>
          Rise, fighting for life <br>
          We rise!

        may the trees grow tall,  <br>
        may the earth be shared by all.
