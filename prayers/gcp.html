        <h2>A Liturgy for Palestine</h2>
        <p>E te Atua, God of truth,<br> 
Let us not hide behind sterilised language and empty statements,<br> 
Let us not pray for peace in the Holy Land without committing ourselves to the Holy Work of solidarity.<br> 
Let us hear truth, share truth, and listen to the experts when they speak. Alongside Palestinian, Israeli, and international human rights groups, let us call a spade a spade.<br> 
Where Israel is committing apartheid, let us call it apartheid.<br> 
Let us call a military occupation; military occupation.<br> 
And let us hear the wisdom of experts who overwhelmingly identify Israel&rsquo;s violence in Gaza as genocidal.<br> 
<strong>Lord, have mercy</strong><br> 
Christ have mercy<br> 
<strong>Lord, have mercy</strong> 
          </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <p>Here together, and with all who seek peace;<br>
        <strong>We call</strong> for an enduring and sustained ceasefire<br>
        <strong>We call</strong> for the immediate flow of food, water, aid, fuel and humanitarian assistance.<br>
        <strong>We call</strong> for the release of all hostages&mdash;both the Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and the Palestinian hostages held in the Israeli prison system. <br>
        <strong>We call</strong> for an end to the military occupation so that a just-peace can begin. Lord, hear our prayers. <strong>Amen.</strong> <br> <br>

        <em>Invite a moment of silence or some time of reflection</em>

  <div class="card">
    <p><strong>We stand with</strong><br>
      all those who have been killed<br>
      <strong>We stand with</strong><br>
      all those who have fled<br>
      <strong>We stand with</strong><br>
      all those who are hungry<br>
      <strong>We stand with</strong><br>
      All those who mourn<br>
      <strong>We stand with</strong><br>
      The orphan, the widow, the lonely<br>

      <strong>Christ have mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>
      </p>

<div class="card">
  <p>Lord, give us the steadfast perseverance of &lsquo;Sumud&rsquo; and the love-centred justice of &lsquo;Mishpat&rsquo; as we seek your shalom and salam.<br>
    Lord, where is your peace?<br>
    <strong>Lord, where is your peace?</strong> <br>
    <strong>Lord, bring us your peace.</strong>
    </p>

<div class="card">
  <p><strong>God our Healer,</strong> <br>
Heal us when we are wounded by the sin of apathy, <br>
Heal us when we are paralysed by social discomfort in the face of explicit slaughter. <br>
Heal us, please let us be changed by our love for all your people <br>
You love the widows, the orphans, the oppressed. <br>
<strong>
  We need your healing, merciful God, give us true repentance. <br>
  Some sins are plain to us, some escape us, some we cannot face.  <br>
  Forgive us, set us free to hear your word in us, set us free to serve you. 
</strong>
    </p>

<div class="card">
  <p>God of the Nations, <br>
    Teach all of us to resolve injustices with righteousness. <br>
    Guard our hearts against retaliation, and give us hearts for love alone.  <br>
    <strong>Lord have mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>
    </p>

</div>

<div class="card">
  <p><strong>Holy God</strong> <br>
Teach us to worship only You, and to follow in your ways of nonviolent peace-making. <br>
We confess that at times we worship the god of comfort, the god of convenience, the god of busyness. <br>
Let us be transformed by the renewing of our minds to only worship You, God of Justice, God who is Life Itself, God who is Love. <br>
<strong>Lord have mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>
    </p>

</div>

<div class="card">
  <p>May, we as the Body of Christ, live out what you call true worship: <br>
    <strong>&ldquo;Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelterâ€” when you see the naked, to clothe them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?&rdquo;</strong> <br>
    <em>(Isaiah 58:6&ndash;7 NIV)</em>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <p><strong>
    Break our hearts open for what breaks yours <br>
      That your healing-justice might flow through us <br>
      We long for peace and for justice,<br>
      for an end to oppression, occupation and suffering.

<div class="card">
  <p>God of Peace,<br>
    As we embark on this journey of solidarity and advocacy, we ask for your guidance and strength.<br>
    Prepare our hearts to be vessels of peace and understanding, granting us the wisdom to speak with humility<br>
    and the courage to listen with empathy.<br>
    We lift up all those who suffer in Gaza, the West Bank<br>
    and Palestinians throughout the Diaspora,<br>
    Asking you to bring peace and justice where there is fear, violence and despair.<br>
    Empower us to be voices of love and reason,<br>
    speaking out against injustice and oppression<br>
    with hearts set on peace and solidarity for our fellow creation<br>
    May we who do not yet know the boundlessness of your love<br>
    be awakened to the overwhelming light of your compassion,<br>
    breaking off the ways of man and embracing the loving mercies of your kingdom<br>
    Bless us on this journey, Lord,<br>
    transforming us with every step<br>
    for change and justice for those suffering in Gaza<br>
    In the name of Jesus Christ,<br>
    and through the power of the Holy Spirit, <br>
    <strong>Amen</strong>
    </p>

<div class="card">
  <p>Lord, let freedom ring. <br>
    Let the streets cry out freedom.<br>
    Bring a revolution of compassion and love to transform this world <br>
    Dismantle our systems of injustice, provoke and renew us, your church. <br>
    Your kingdom come, your will be done.

<div class="card">
  <p><strong>God of life,</strong> <br>
    We are filled with gratitude for the courage and steadfastness of the medical professionals, the journalists, the taxi drivers, and the rescue workers in Gaza. Let us be moved by their unwavering commitment to saving and empowering human life, let it be a powerful reflection of the goodness and compassion within the Gaza community. God -may their acts of love and benevolence inspire and uplift all who strive for freedom, justice, and security. Send your Holy Spirit to all who are injured, sick, and trapped under the rubble. <br>
    <strong>Lord of mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>

<div class="card">
  <p>E te Atua, <strong>God of Mercy,</strong> <br>
    Right now our family starves<br>
    Right now our family thirsts<br>
    Right now our family needs to grieve, but has to run <br>
    Right now our family buries the victims of terror. <br>
    Move us with the urgency of love<br>
    Fix our eyes to see You in every stranger<br>
    <strong>Lord have mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <p>E te Atua, <strong>God of healing,</strong> <br>
    You know the pain, you know the loneliness, the weakness and the degradation that it brings; you know the agony. <br>
Jesus, your suffering is the only hope, the only reconciliation for those who suffer.<br>
Be with Gazans as they grapple with the pain they suffer now. Be a promise to them that this present suffering will cease. Be the hand that they can hold Be present, Lord, for those who need you now.<br>
    <strong>Lord have mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <p>E te Atua, <strong>God of action,</strong> <br>
    May our calls for justice echo from these streets to the halls of power,  <br>
    May they fall loudly on the ears of our politicians and faith leaders, <br>
May our feet drum the sounds of a coming peace,  <br>
and may this pavement tell the story that we were here. <br>
That we walked. <br>
That we stood for justice and peace, not just in word but in action.
