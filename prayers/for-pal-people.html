        <h2>A Prayer for the Palestinian People</h2>
        <p>In the name of Elohim, the most merciful. May the Palestinian people receive the healing powers of our prayers. May they be granted safety, success, love, security, and hope. May they enjoy the fruits of freedom and equality that they—and all human beings—deserve. <br> <br>

          As Jews, we pray for their well-being. We remember that the Holy Land is a shared space and pray to see the day when Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, and all religions will live there together in peace. <br> <br>
          
          We hope for the day when Palestinian refugees may return. We pray that together with their Jewish neighbors they can rehabilitate their history and rebuild what could be the best place on Earth. A place of many cultures and true equality. <br> <br>
          
          We pray that Palestinians will be able to live lives free from violence and oppression. And we ask God to help us build bridges of peace with them. <br> <br>
          
          יְהִי אוֹר; וַיְהִי-אוֹר <br> <br>
          
          “Let there be light. And there was light.” <br> <br>
          
          May we be the light that brings peace and hope to our Palestinian friends and to all the world. Amen. <br>
