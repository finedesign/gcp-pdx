        <h2>A Liturgy for Palestine</h2>
        <p><strong>God of Comfort,</strong> <br>
          send your Spirit to encompass all those whose lives <br> 
          are torn apart by violence and death in the state of Israel and Palestine. <br>
          You are the Advocate of the oppressed  <br>
          and the One whose eye is on the sparrow. <br>
          Let arms reach out in healing, rather than aggression. <br>
          Let hearts mourn rather than militarize. <br> <br>

          <strong>Christ have mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>
          </p>

    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>God our Healer,</strong> <br>
        Our souls are wounded by the sin of apathy, we are paralysed with overwhelm. <br>
        Please heal us, please let us be changed by our love for what you love. <br>
        You love the widows, the orphans, the oppressed. <br>
        We need your healing, merciful God, give us true repentance. <br>
        Some sins are plain to us, some escape us, some we cannot face. <br>
        Forgive us, set us free to hear your word in us, set us free to serve you. <br> <br>

        <em>Invitation to a moment of silence</em>

  <div class="card">
    <p><strong>God of the Nations,</strong> <br>
      let not one more child or elder be sacrificed on altars of political expediency. <br> 
Keep safe all people from unjust leaders who would exploit vulnerability for their own distorted ends. <br> 
Give wise discernment to those making decisions to pursue just peace. <br> 
Provide them insight into fostering justice, freedom, and shalom for all. <br> 
Teach all of us to resolve injustices with righteousness. <br> 
Guard our hearts against retaliation, and give us hearts for love alone. <br> <br>

      <strong>Lord have mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>
      </p>

</div>

<div class="card">
  <p><strong>God of Mercy,</strong> <br>
    Right now our family starves<br>
Right now our family thirsts<br>
Right now our family needs to grieve but has to run <br>
Right now our family buries the victims of terror<br>
Move us with the urgency of love<br>
Fix our eyes to see You in every stranger <br> <br>

    <strong>Lord have mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>
    </p>

</div>

<div class="card">
  <p><strong>God of Justice,</strong> <br>
    Give strength to those whose long work for a just peace might seem fruitless now. Strengthen their resolve.<br> 
Do not let them feel alone. Show us how to support their work and bolster their courage. Guide religious leaders to model unity and reconciliation across lines of division.<br> 
Guide political leaders to listen with their hearts as they seek peace and pursue it.<br> 
Rebuke the powerful and lift up the lowly.<br> 
Help all people choose the rigorous, gritty path of just peace. <br> <br>

    <strong>Lord have mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>
    </p>

</div>

<div class="card">
  <p><strong>God of Hope,</strong> <br>
    We lift up Palestine — its people, its land, its creatures. we lift up the cities of the region: Gaza City and Tel Aviv, Ramallah and Ashkelon, Deir El Balah and Sderot, so long divided, yet so filled with life and creativity. <br>
Come again to breathe peace on your peoples that all may recognize you. <br> <br>

    <strong>Lord have mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>
    </p>

</div>

<div class="card">
  <p><strong>God of Mercy,</strong> <br>
    Even now work on the hearts of combatants
to choose life over death, reconciliation over retaliation, restoration over destruction. Help us resist racism in all its forms, especially in our own churches.<br>
We confess that many of our Churches in the U.S. and in the West have been complicit in their silence, while others use your name to endorse violence in the Holy Land. <br> <br>

    <strong>We bless your holy name, which has been used here in vain. <br>
      Christ have mercy, hear our prayer.</strong>
    </p>

</div>

<div class="card">
  <p><strong>Holy God</strong> <br>
    Teach us to worship only You.
Teach us to follow in only your ways.
We confess that at times we worship the god of comfort, the god of convenience, the god of busyness.
Let us wrestle with You and walk from here with a limp.
Let us be transformed by the renewing of our minds to only worship You, God of Justice, God who is Life Itself, God who is Love Itself. <br> <br>

    <strong>Maranatha, come soon Lord Jesus.</strong>
    </p>

</div>

<div class="card">
  <p><strong>God of Comfort,</strong> <br>
    Strengthen our faith in you,<br>
O God of All Flesh,<br>
even when we don't have clear answers,<br>
so that we may still offer ourselves for the cause of peace.<br>
We ache. There is pain here in this night. Let joy come in the morning. </p>
