We lift up all those who suffer in Gaza, the West Bank and Palestinians throughout the Diaspora, Asking you to bring peace and justice where there is fear, violence and despair. Empower us to be voices of love and reason, speaking out against injustice and oppression with hearts set on peace and solidarity for our fellow creation May we who do not yet no the boundlessness of your love be awakened to the overwhelming light of your compassion, breaking off the ways of man and embracing the loving mercies of your kingdom Bless us on this journey, Lord, transforming us with every step for change and justice for those suffering in Gaza In the name of Jesus Christ, and through the power of the Holy Spirit, <br /><br />
