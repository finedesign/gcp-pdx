        <h2>GCP - A Via Dolorosa of Solidarity</h2>
        <h3>The Way of the Cross / Walking in God&rsquo;s Nonviolent-Resurrection-Power</h3>
        <h4>Each Day: Set Your Intention</h4>

        <ol><li>Our prayer: May Jesus&rsquo; way of healing-justice through nonviolent-enemy-love be how the Gaza Ceasefire Pilgrimages are to be experienced by all.</li>
          <li>We remember those who remain hostage and their families.</li>
          <li>We are about nonviolent solidarity not neutrality. We value every human life as made in the image of God.</li>
          <li>We remember the families who have been displaced.</li>
          <li>We engage in the Gaza Ceasefire Pilgrimage as an act of repentance. On behalf of ourselves, our churches, and our nations. Both the sins of omission in not standing with the Palestinian people, or in the sins of commission.</li>
            <li>We stand in solidarity with other participants in the Gaza Ceasefire Pilgrimage.</li>
            <li><em>Gaza Ceasefire Pilgrimages are the Church clearly calling for 1) a lasting ceasefire 2) immediate humanitarian relief 3) all hostages released 4) and an end to occupation.</em></li>
            <li><em>The Gaza Ceasefire Pilgrimage movement is not merely one particular tactic but a response from the Body of Christ to a movement of the Spirit of God.</em></li>

            <li>We prayfor elected leaders in their decisions about foreign policy and aid.</li>
            <li><em>We are animated by &ldquo;a shared spirituality of change&rdquo;.</em></li>
            <li>This side of the Resurrection, we can name the cross as Jesus&rsquo; confrontational unmasking of the principalities and Powers of domination, sin and death: Powers that demand our complicity under threat of humiliation, torture and death. It is these Powers that the ancient church proclaimed have been disarmed, made a spectacle of, and triumphed over by Jesus upon the cross. (Colossians 2:15)</li>
            <li>&ldquo;There is no greater testament to the love of Jesus, and thus God&rsquo;s love for creation, than the cross.&rdquo; <br>
              ~Rev Dr Kelly Brown Douglas</li>

            <li>&ldquo;If prayer is to be transmuted into action, then this Trinitarian faith which informs all our praying must also be manifest in our daily life... our faith in the Trinity puts us under an obligation to struggle at every level, from the strictly personal to the highly organised, against all forms of oppression, injustice and exploitation.&rdquo; <br>
            ~Greek Orthodox Bishop Kallistos Ware</li>
            <li>Prayer for us is not the conclusion of compassion. rather, humble prayer is the place where grief is transmuted into grace, lament mixes with praise, and despair wrestles with deliverance until compassion is conceived and is birthed into the action of taking up our cross and trusting in the nonviolent power that raised Jesus from the grave.</li>
            <li>May I live with integrity, as a loving presence in the world. May my will be one with your will. ~Nan Merrill Psalm 10</li>

            <li><em>Resurrection means, <br>
              Victory of life over death.<br>
              Victory of light over the darkness of occupation. <br>
              Victory of love over hate. <br>
              Victory of justice over oppression <br>
              Victory of compassion over hardness and callousness of heart<br>
              Victory of hope over despair <br>
              Victory of peace over conflict and war<br>
              Victory of reconciliation and forgiveness over revenge and vengeance<br>
              Victory of nonviolence over violence<br>
              Victory of peace, security, and wellbeing over chaos, insecurity, and fear.</em><br>
              ~Palestinian Anglican Priest Naim Ateek</li>
              <li><em>This is what Resurrection means for us. It also carries with it responsibility and accountability. <strong>This must be our earnest and fervent prayer to God as we remember Christ&rsquo;s victory over evil and death.&rdquo;</strong></em></li>
              <li>Prayer for us is compassion as action. Prayer for us is responding to God&rsquo;s goodness by doing justice, loving mercy and walking humbly with our God. For us, pilgrimage is another form of prayer.</li>
              <li><strong>Solidarity.</strong> <br>
              &ldquo;If one part suffers, we all suffer...&rdquo; -1 Corinthians 12:26 Prayer opens our hearts to share in God&rsquo;s heart with those who are suffering. The Gaza Ceasefire Pilgrimages seek to listen to, learn from, and lead with Palestinian Christians ...we build community, encourage solidarity and organise in unity with those who experience these horrors most directly.</li>
              <li>We pray for relief and medical workers persisting in dire circumstances in order to help others.</li>
              <li>Lord, that I might hold you more closely I would that my consciousness were as wide as the skies and the earth And the peoples of the earth; As deep as the past, the desert, the ocean; As tenuous as the atoms of matter Or the thoughts do the human heart. <br>
                ~Teilhard de Chardin</li>
              <li>To take up the cross is to share in Christ&rsquo;s sufferings that seek to end the suffering of others. To follow Jesus is to be found where he is found, with those considered last, least, lost, looked over, scapegoated and forgotten. As Palestinian Lutheran Pastor, Rev Dr. Munther Isaac reminds us,  &ldquo;Where is God as Gaza is being bombed? God is under the rumble.&rdquo; The question for us is, will we be with God as God is with them?</li>
              <li>&ldquo;Come, O Beloved, make your home in my heart.&rdquo; <br>
                ~Nan Merrill, Psalm 13</li>
              <li><strong>Transfiguring Trauma.</strong><br>
                On Pilgrimage we will work with our trauma, metabolise its truth, alchemise its power and welcome God&rsquo;s healing. We will do so not through avoidance, but through engaged solidarity as we prayerfully map Gaza onto our own locations with our bodies.</li>
                <li><strong>Healing Hatred.</strong> <br>
                  &ldquo;Jesus rejected hatred.... Jesus rejected hatred because he saw that hatred meant death to the mind, death to the spirit, death to communion with his Father. He affirmed life; and hatred was the great denial.&rdquo; <br>
                  -Howard Thurman</li>
