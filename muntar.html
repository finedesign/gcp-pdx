        <h2>Muntar Isaac Prayer</h2>
        <p>My God, my God, why did you leave Gaza? <br>
          How long will you forget her completely? <br>
          Why do you hide your face from Gaza? <br>
          In the daytime I call upon you, but you do not answer; by night we find no rest. <br>
          Do not depart from the people of Gaza, <br>
          for distress is near, for there is no one to help. Our souls and our lives approach the abyss, Our eyes melt from humiliation <br>
          We call upon you, Lord, every day. <br>
          We stretch out our hands to you. <br>
          Why, Lord, do you reject our souls? <br>
          Why do you hide your face from us? <br> <br>

          Rev. Dr. Munther Isaac, Lutheran Pastor in Bethlehem Adapted from Psalms 13, 22, and 88
